1. To test the test code for visualization, make sure to have the test data set available in the same folder

2. The filter and pulldown list have been finished, and its location and animation need to be slightly adjusted. The legend should be able to control the display of the corresponding plot line.

3. Now developing new icons and control surfaces for smoother operation. Is a bar chart close to the corresponding cluster name necessary for showing the percentage it occupies in the entire cell? Also, some filters (clear/show) and search bars could be implemented for a better visualization experience.

4. The script should run on a local server to avoid issues with updates and costs for now, will use Azure to host the website when all of the desired functions are finished and able to be published.
